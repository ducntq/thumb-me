A minimalistic web server created for one job: making thumbnail.

behind a web proxy such as nginx.

This is a work in progress, any contributions are welcome.

1. Handlers to make thumbnails.
2. Token for self-protection.
3. Multiple domains support.
4. Ability to serve from file system, network file system, or others... through adapter.
